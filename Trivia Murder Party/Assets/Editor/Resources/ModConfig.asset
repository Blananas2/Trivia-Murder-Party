  description: "Modules based on the Trivia Murder Party minigames from both packs
    one and two. This pack is incomplete, but more modules will be added eventually.\r\n\r\nThe
    modules included (In chronological order of me adding them):\r\n\r\nMental Math:
    The Math Minigame from games 1 and 2.\r\nSolve simple math equations consecutively.
    The amount you need to answer is based on your progress in the bomb.\r\n\r\nThe
    Arena: The Rock-Paper-Scissors Minigame From games 1 and 2\r\nDetermine if you
    should attack, defend, or grab based off of some edgework rules!\r\n\r\nDictation:

    out. Submit a specific word once the phrase is done.\r\n\r\nJailbreak: The Password
    Minigame from game 2\r\nGuess the four letter password in 90 seconds, invalid
    words will not give you any hints.\r\n\r\nDumb Waiters (Implemented by TasThing):
    The Dumb Waiters Minigame from game 2\r\nChoose which elevator you should bunker
    in, and try to live based on who chose what.\r\n\r\nChalices: The minigame of
    the same name from both games.\r\nFollow a flow chart to determine which chalice
    you should drink from.\r\n\r\nPixel Art: The Memory minigame from games 1 and
