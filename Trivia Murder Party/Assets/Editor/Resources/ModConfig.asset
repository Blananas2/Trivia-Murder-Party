  title: Trivia Murder Party Pack
  author: Me
  description: "Modules based on the Trivia Murder Party minigames from both packs
    one and two. This pack is incomplete, but more modules will be added eventually.\r\n\nWhile
    not included in this pack, and also has no relation to this modpack, for a full
    experience I would highly recommend the TMP Gameplay room at https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2409797804
    made by TheDarkSid3r.\n\r\nThe modules included (In chronological order of me
    adding them):\r\n\r\nMental Math (Math):\r\nSolve simple math equations consecutively.
    The amount you need to answer is based on your progress in the bomb.\r\n\r\nThe
    Arena (Rock-Paper-Scissors, implementation by Blananas2):\r\nDetermine the order
    of the attack/defend/grab minigames and complete all of them perfectly.\r\n\r\nDictation:\r\nWrite
    down the phrase as it's being read out. Submit a specific word once the phrase
    is done.\r\n\r\nJailbreak (Password):\r\nGuess the four letter password in 90
    seconds, invalid words will not give you any hints.\r\n\r\nDumb Waiters (Implemented
    by TasThing):\r\nChoose which elevator you should bunker in, and try to live based
    on who chose what.\r\n\r\nChalices:\r\nFollow a flow chart to determine which
    chalice you should drink from.\r\n\r\nPixel Art (Memory):\r\nRecreate the pattern
    shown exactly when it was shown for 7 seconds.\r\n\r\nRules:\r\nFollow the rules
    shown correctly, the amount you need to follow corresponds to how much time is
    left on the bomb.\r\n\r\nSkewers:\r\nDetermine the position of five skewers based
    on the colors of gems shown and find a safe spot to hide in. \r\n\r\nManuals can
    be found at https://ktane.timwi.de/ or in the manuals folder of your game.\r\n\r\nIf
    there are any bugs, contact Fartlicker777#9169 on Discord."
